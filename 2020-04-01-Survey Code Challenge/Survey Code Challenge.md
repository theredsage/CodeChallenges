# Preface
​
The csv below is a list of survey data collected from 1 million different people.* Your job is to help the data scientists discover different things about this data.
​
_*This data was randomly generated and does not contain any personal data. Any similarities to real people are coincidental_

# The Challenge
​
Write a script that allows you to analyze this data and provide answers to the following questions:
​
1. What is the total average Salary?
2. What is the average GPA for people who's last names begin with "A"
3. What is the most popular profession?
4. What is the median age of people who are married
​

The program should then print these answers in order to stdout, with a numbered answer for each question:

_(These are not the actual answers)_

```
1. $120,000
2. 3.2
3. Dentist
4. 42
```
​
Your solution should be written in a language that you are comfortable with. You *should not* use external toolsets such as apache spark or relational databases to assist in analyzing this data.
​
Your code should be well structured, extensible, and easy to understand.
​
# Criteria
​
You will be judged on:

- the structure of your code
- readability
- extensibility
- memory usage (min/max/avg)
- the runtime of your solution
​
### On Extensibility

Later in the interview process, you may be asked to answer another question about this data set using your implementation.
